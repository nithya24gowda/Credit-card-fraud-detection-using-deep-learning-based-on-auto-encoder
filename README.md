Frauds have no constant patterns. They always change their behavior; so, we need to use an unsupervised learning. Fraudsters learn about new technology that allows them to execute frauds through online transactions. Fraudsters assume the regular behavior of consumers, and fraud patterns change fast. So, fraud detection systems need to detect online transactions by using unsupervised learning, because some fraudsters commit frauds once through online mediums and then switch to other techniques.The proposed deep learning based on auto-encoder (AE) is an unsupervised learning algorithm that applies backpropagation by setting the inputs equal to the outputs.
